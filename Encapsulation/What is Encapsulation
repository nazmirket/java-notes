>>What is Encapsulation ?

    > Encapsulation is a way to give partial access to others to a property
    
    > If we don't want other blocks to change the variable without limitation
       we can use encapsulation
       
    > As mentioned before, in OOP, the getter and setters are used to give access 
        to some people to private properties  
        
    > If we control the setter method with conditionals, the variable can take only some values
       that we wanted.
