>>What is an Abstact class ?

    > Abstract class can include both abstract methods and normal methods
     
    > If a method is used in all subclasses, it is more practical that giving a body to it
       in abstract class
    
    > Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, we cannot create object from these classes
