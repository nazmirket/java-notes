* What is Concurrency?
   - The systems that able to do more than one thing at a time called concurrent systems.

* What is a Thread?
   - Simply means that the small parts of a proccess.
   - A proccess has at least one thread and so there might be more than one.
   - Thread class implements Runnable interface and this interface has only one method " void run () ".
   - Thread runs this method when the method " thread1.start()" invoked.
   - "CreatingAThread.java" document explains how to create a new thread. 
   - Basic methods are explained in the file "BasicMethods.java"

* What is "join()" method for?
   - This method is used to keep waiting some thread until the other one is done
   - The example in the file "JoinMethod.java" would be more helpful to understand

* Possible Errors about Threads:
    > Thread Interference : It occurs when more than one threads try to get access to same resource
    > Memory Consistency Error : These occur when different threads have inconsistent views of 
    what should be the same data. To avoid this error the happens-before relationship is created.

* What is a Synchronized Method?
   - The methods that declared with "synchronized" keyword caled "synchronized methods".
   - These methods cannot be running in two different thread at the same time
   - If one thread is using this method the other one waits it to finish
   - Even you have two different "synchronized" methods only one of them is executed at a time(^)
   - "SynchronizedMethods.java" document includes an example about this concept
   
* What is a Synchronized Statement?
   - Because of the situation about synchronized methods described in fourth one above(^). Even we have
      to seperate object we can't use them at the same time with synchronized methods
    - Synchronized statements lock a specific object so we can use seperate objects, this is a good way to
       improve concurrency. This concept called "fine-grained synchronization"
    - For more explanation with examples "SynchronizedStatements.java"
    
    
* Some terms about concurrency:
    >Volatile Keyword : the variables that declared with this keyword are kept in the ram periodical and in this way
       the value that the variable has is becoming visible for other threads
    >Intrinsic lock : the way that the synchronized method lock others. In this type of lock the other threads doesn't keep working
       even they don't use that synchronised method.
    >Wait() and Notify() : These two methods used for the synchronization between two threads. When the one invokes
       wait() method the lock is released and the other one is starts running and when the other one invokes notify() method,
       the first one waits until the second one is done and keeps running. For more explanation "WaitAndNotify.java"
