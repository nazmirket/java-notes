>>What is Polymorphism ?

    > An interface is a contract that includes the functions will be used
     
    > All methods are abstract in an interface except the statics and defaults so "abstract" keyword is unnecessary
    
    > We can't create an object from an interface
    
    > An interface can be extended from more than one interface
    
    > A class can implement more than one interface
    
    > The Interface's abstract methods can get a body at where they implemented 
    
    > When adding something to interface is needed we should create default methods 
       or new interfaces that extends the older one!!
